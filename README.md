## What?
This repo has my solutions to the various exercises and programming projects found throughout the book [C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504) by K. N. King. 
My solutions may not be correct, or the most efficient, or concise, but I try my best. If you come across any errors or things I could've done better, please tell me about it.

## Why?
Well aside from the benefits of revision control, this is good practice for using Git and it keeps me more motivated to work on it continuously. Since this is public, I might also get some constructive criticism. This book is my first attempt at getting a more full understanding of C.
