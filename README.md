This repo has my solutions to the various exercises and programming projects
found throughout the book [C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd
Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504)
by K. N. King. If you come across any errors or things I could've done better,
please tell me about it.
