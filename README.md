## What?
This repo has my solutions to the various exercises and programming projects found throughout the book [C Programming: A Modern Approach, 2nd Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Programming-Modern-Approach-2nd-Edition/dp/0393979504) by K. N. King.

## Why?
Primarily because I was inspired by [this guy](https://github.com/pingles/c-programming-a-modern-approach), but it's also good practice for Git/Hub and it'll keep me more organized. Plus doing all this extra work will probably help with retaining everything!
